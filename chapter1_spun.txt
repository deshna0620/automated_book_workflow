THE GATES OF MORNING

CHAPTER I

Rayson, awakened suddenly from sleep, lay still and listened intently. The house was so silent that he could hear the soft rustling of coconut palm fronds outside. Moonlight streamed through the slats of the jalousies, casting narrow lines of brightness across the floor. Through the open window, the sea glittered faintly, and in the distance, the white foam outlined the reef.

It wasn't the familiar sounds of the sea or the whispering palms that had disturbed him; this was different—a low, steady hum, like the faint noise of distant machinery. The sound seemed to drift from the direction of the reef. Curious, Rayson rose from bed and approached the window.

At first, the moonlit view revealed only the ghostly outline of the reef and the dark stretch of water beyond. Then he noticed a light gliding along the reef’s edge. The distance made it hard to see clearly, but the light moved deliberately, vanishing at times behind coral rocks, then reappearing along the reef.

Rayson watched, unsettled. What could this light be? Perhaps a boat with a lantern at its bow? But why would any boat be moving so slowly and mysteriously at this late hour?

A gentle breeze carried distant voices to his ear—soft and indistinct. He couldn’t make out the words, only the rise and fall of murmuring sounds that faded into silence. The light continued its slow journey until it vanished behind a jut of the reef.

Rayson stepped away from the window, thoughtful. The house remained deeply quiet; everyone else seemed asleep. After a moment’s hesitation, he threw a cloak over his shoulders and quietly slipped out of the room and down the stairs.
